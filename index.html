      <h2>A breakdown of the writing behind Apple TV+'s hit series "Ted Lasso"</h2>

      <h2>"Hey, how y'all doing? I'm Ted Lasso, your new coach."</h2>
      <p>Originally based on a popular commercial launched to promote English Premiere League matches in the United States, “Ted Lasso” is a comedy series centered around an American football coach and title character Ted Lasso. Ted, a middle-aged, mustached, Midwestern man, is hired to manage a professional soccer club in England despite having no experience in the beloved sport. While on the surface, the show seems like a goofy series about a fish out of water as Ted navigates a whole new career and culture, “Ted Lasso” has gained critical acclaim in the depth of its writing and the themes it explores, often blurring the lines between comedy and drama. In its freshman season, the show even shattered records for a comedy series, earning a whopping 20 Emmy nominations and going on to win 7 of them. Sports series have long been known to lose interest quickly — much more so when the sport is one that's not particularly favored in this country... So what exactly makes this series so moving and so special? </p>

      <h2>One-dimensional optimism?</h2>
      <h3>A closer look at the emotional arcs over the first two seasons</h3>
      <p>Released in August 2020, “Ted Lasso” is said to have come at a time when audiences needed it most. Five long months into the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us can relate to feeling disillusioned, downtrodden, and dejected with the current state of the world. Cue Ted Lasso with all of his laughter and positivity, and viewers really took to the show — especially at the start of its second season, released in July 2021. At a time of such division and uncertainty, “Ted Lasso” provides a comforting alternative.</p>

      <p>However, not everyone is convinced by the seeming rainbows and sunshine that Ted has to offer. Critics point out Ted’s overbearing, perhaps unrealistic optimism — how much can a show really offer if it only goes as deep as a few mushy and maudlin cliches? </p>
        
      <p>What, then, does the breakdown of “Ted Lasso” dialogue actually look like?</p>

      <p>Sadness
        •	Sadness is closely aligned with joy for majority of S1
        •	Surprisingly low during seemingly sad episodes like when they get relegated, surprisingly high during seemingly happy episodes like Christmas episode
        •	Very low at beginning of S2
        o	Hints of Ted being depressed underneath, toxic positivity
        o	 Sadness surfaces as Ted faces panic attacks, confesses father’s suicide
        
        Disgust
        •	Nate starts bullying Colin, Will
        
        Anger
        •	Conflicts arise
        o	Keeley / Roy
        o	Roy / Jamie
        o	Nate / everyone
        o	Rebecca / Sam
        
        Fear
        •	Nate betrays Ted
        
        More complex toward end of S2… signals uncertainty for S3

    <div id="apologies-section" class="text">
      <h2>"Accountability matters"</h2>
      <h3>Every apology given by a main character</h3>
      <p>Central to what makes “Ted Lasso” feel so refreshing are its themes of accountability and apology. In S01E04: For the Children, we quickly learn the importance of accountability in the lives of the characters in Richmond, as Keeley perfectly serves up the above quote while breaking up with Jamie. The writers only continue this thread as the seasons progress, even devoting an entire episode to asking for forgiveness in S01E09: All Apologies.</p>

      <p>When taking a closer look, though, who do we see apologizing to whom, and how? What are the relationship dynamics surrounding these apologies — like gender and power, for instance — and how do characters respond to accountability? 
        </p>
      
      <p>Note that here, we define an apology as one that (1) is sincere, (2) is given by a main character for something that they genuinely did wrong (i.e. not just as a courtesy or filler word), and (3) drives plot and/or character development.</p>
